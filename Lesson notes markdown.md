# lesson 11
  ### % Composition

  **difference between a compound and a molecule**
  ```
  compound: A compound is made of more than one type of element.
  molecule: A molecule is a group of elements that doesn't have to be the same type
  ```
  **Everything around us is typically made up of more than one element. Some things on this earth are made up of a single substance such as;**
  ```
  gold: pure Au,
  hydrogen: H,
  silver: Ag,

  Lots of these elements are rare.
  ```
  **Why do most things not exist in our earth as pure substances?**
  ```
  Like ionic compounds, most stable react together naturally. Different areas on the periodic table are more reactive than others.
  ```
  **What percent of the mass of water is made up of oxygen?**

  > **How to find the mass of water?**
>  ```
Find mass number of hydrogen: 1,
Find mass number of oxygen: 16,
Oxygen is made up of: (2 * H) + (1 * O),
Substitute in values: (2 * 1) + (1 * 16),
Mass of water: (2 + 16),
Mass of water: (18)
```
> **Finding % composition of oxygen in water**
>  ```
(Mass of oxygen / Mass of water) * 100,
;
example:
%O: (16 / 18) * 100
%O: (0.8889) * 100
%O: 88.89% Oxygen
```
> **Finding % composition of grams of a substance**
> ```
example:
72g of hydrocarbon has 12g of hydrogen. What is % of carbon?
Carbon: 60g,
Hydrogen: 12g,
;
Molar mass of carbon: 12,
Molar mass of hydrogen: 1,
;
Number of moles of carbon: 60g / 12amu = 5 moles of carbon,
Number of moles of hydrogen: 12g / 1amu = 12 moles of hydrogen,
;
%C: (5 / (5 + 12)) * 100
%C: (5 / 17) * 100
%C: 29%
```

**Emperical vs Molecular formula**
  > ```
Molecular formula: Shows the actual number of each atom within a molecule.
example: C2H4
;
Emperical formula: smallest whole number ratio of each atom within a compound.
example: CH2
```
> **Finding emperical from molecular**
> ```
You have to find the number of each atom then find the lowest ratio of the atoms.
example;
;
Mg3Cl6
Mg: 3, Cl: 6. <-- find the amount of each atom
1 : 2<-- find lowest ratio
MgCl2 <-- change name  to match
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Lesson 12

### Doing the magnesium prac. We have to burn magnesium to create magnesium oxide: MgO;

##### What could affect the purity of our compound in this experiment?
```
1. There are more elements than just oxygen in the surrounding air.
2. Nitrogen will also react with magnesium and compete to make magnesium Nitride instead of magnesium oxide.
3. The masses we get from the balances could cause systematic errors
4. Human errors; table bumps, fuckin bad measurements etc.
5. Some of the magnesium might not react and leave some sort of residue.
6. Some of the magnesium may have already reacted with the air. We need to rub this magnesium oxide off.
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------


# lesson 13
#### Empirical Formula (simplest whole number of atoms) ####

**How to find Emperical formula from % of atoms**

```
42.9% C == 57.1% O;
assumed 100g;
42.9g C, 57.1g O;

n = m/Me: Divide these numbers by their respective molar mass;
example:  42.9 / C --> 42.9 / 12 --> 3.57
example: 57.1 / O --> 57.1 / 16 --> 3.57

to find the ration divide the number by the smallest number:
3.57 / 3.57 --> 1 --> ration = 1:1;

So now u have the ratio and u just apply it to the formula:
CO = CO;
```
**example 2**
```
9.6g C, 0.67g H, 4.7g Cl;
9.6 / 12 = 0.8, 0.61 / 1 = 0.67, 4.7 / 35.5 = 0.13;

0.8/0.13 = 6, 0.67/0.13 = 5, 0.13/0.13 = 1;
ratio = 6:5:1
C6H5Cl
```
**What if i get 2.5 of an atom**
```
If you get 2.5 of an atom then multiply by 2.
example:
  82.75 C / 12 = 6.89
  17.25 H / 1 = 17.25

  16.25 / 6.98 = 2.5
  ratio = 1 : 2.5  --> * 2
  ratio = 2 : 5
  C2H5
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 14
#### molecular formula
**What is molecular formula**
```
Molecular formula is the actual formula of the compound. The empirical
formula just gives us a ration of atoms whilst the molecular Shows us
exactly how many atoms there are.
```
**Empirical ---> Molecular**
```
Empirical formula is a ratio of atoms.
HO ---> H2O2
It is also a ratio of mass
17 ---> 34
You can see that the molar mass of H2O2 is double the molar mass of HO because it is a ratio

The ratio of the atoms = 34/17 = 2

Mass of empirical formula * ratio = Mass of molecular formula

Mass of molecular formula / Mass of empirical formula = ratio
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 15

```
When we get an error we should be able to figure out how much they affected the data.
We must quantify the errors.

## Lesson 16
**Bhors theory of shells**
```
  The idea is that electrons are arranged into shells aka; clouds, energy levels, layers or rings.
  They arranged according to energy levels.

  The first shell is the 's' shell. it can hold 2 electrons.
  The second shell is the 'p' shell. it can hold 6 electrons.
  The third shell is the 'd' shell. It can hold 10 electrons.

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 17 ##

**The amazing things about the periodic table**
```
Just by looking at the periodic table you can learn a lot of different things such as:

Shells: You can see which shell the element is in by counting the number of groups.
Electrons: You can see how many electrons are in all elements except the transition metals by counting the number of periods.
Valence electrons: You can see the amount of valence electrons by the charge of the period.
Charge of element: You can find the charge of the element by adding numbers a the top.
Judge the reactivity: You can judge the reactivity of an element by where it is positioned on the table.
Electronegativity: You can judge the Electronegativity of an element by where it is on the periodic Table.
The type of shell its in: You can tell the number of electrons it can hold in its outer shell it is positioned in.
Number of valence electrons: The group number tells us the amount of valence electrons in valence shell.
The mass number: You can tell the mass number by the element symbol.
```

**Trends on the periodic table**
```
Atomic radius trend:
  The atomic radius is the distance between the nucleus of two atoms. This distance is measured in pico-meters.
  Atomic radius increases from left to right and up to down. This means the elements with the largest atomic radius are in the bottom left corner.
  Basically as you go down the amount of shells increases to the radius increases.
  As you go right the amount of electrons increases pulling force between the electrons and protons meaning the atom shrinks a little.

Melting point:
  Metallically bonded and macromolecular substances have high melting points because there is more energy needed to break their bonds.
  Most non-metal have a simple molecular structure and are easy to break the bonds. The strength of the molecular bonds is determined by the size of the molecule.

Electronegativity:
  Electronegativity is a measure of tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The Electronegativity increases from bottom left to top right.
  The increase in Electronegativity is because the nuclear charge of the atom becomes increasingly positive and the constant shielding effects result in greater attractive forces

Ionization energy:
  The ionization energy generally increases from left to right. Electrons in p orbitals are easier to remove than those in s orbitals of the same energy level. If a paired electron is in the same orbital it can lead to repulsion.
```

**Needed equations**
```
Avagadro's constant (NA): 6.02 × 10^23 mol
Charge on one electron: -1.60 × 10^-19
Faraday constant (F): 96,500 C mol
Gas constant(R): 8.31 J K mol
Ionic product for water (Kw): 1 × 10^-14 mol^2 L^-2 at 298 K
Specific heat capacity (c) of water: 4.18 J/g K
Density (d) of water at 25C: 1.00 g / mL
0 C : 273 K
```

**Shielding effect**
```
The electrons on the outer shell are easier to be taken away because their are electrons shielding the magnetism to them.
Shielding happens because the inside electrons are standing in the way of the outside (valence) electrons.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 18 ##

**Bhor's Shells**
```
Shells = layers of electrons;
  Different energy levels in each shell;
  Closer shells have higher energy levels;

Evidence for this?
  Emission light spectra;
    * Heat a chemical.
    * When Atoms are heated their electrons will rapidly change energy levels / shells.
    * When the electrons fall back they release energy in the form of light.
```

```
Ground state:
  When an electron is in its lowest energy level it is in its ground state.
  So it is in its ground state when it is nearest to the nucleus.
```

**Shell types**

| Shell # | Shell Name | # of electrons | Notes |

| 3 | M | 18 | Only for first 20 |

**Bhors model is shit**
## **SHRONGDONGERS MODEL!** ##
```
There are smaller regions of space than shells.
  * Subshells
Then even smaller than subshells we have.
  -> orbitals

Like orbitals we fill the lowest energy space first. In this case; The orbitals and then the subshells and then the shells.
```
**The Periodic Table in terms of orbitals**

| Shell # | # of Subshells | Name of subshells | # of orbital in subshell | Max electrons |
| :------ | :--------- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | s | s=1; | 2×1 = 2 |
| 2 | 2 | s+p | s=1; p=3; 4| 4×2 = 8 |
| 3 | 2 | s+p | s=1; p=3; 4 | 4×2 = 8 |
| 4 | 3 | s+p+d | s=1; p=3; d=5; 9 | 9×2 = 18 |
| 5 | 3 | s+p+d | s=1; p=3; d=5; 9 | 9×2 = 18 |
| 6 | 3 | s+p+d | s=1; p=3; d=5; 9 | 9×2 = 18 |
| 7 | 4 | s+p+d+f | s=1; p=3; d=5; f=7; 16 | 16×2 = 32 |
| 8 | 4 | s+p+d+f | s=1; p=3; d=5; f=7; 16 | 16×2 = 32 |

**Filling electron shells**
```
Fill the lowest level electrons first

Fill it like a bucket;

1s1,
1s2,
1s2 2s1,
1s2 2s2,
1s2 2s2 2p1,
1s2 2s2 2p2,
1s2 2s2 2p3,
1s2 2s2 2p4,
...
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p1,
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p2,
...
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d1,
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d2,
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d3,
...
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p1,
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p2,
```
**Example:**
```
  * 11-Na
    -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1
  * 1-H
    -> 1s1
  * 15-P
    -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5
  * 26-Fe
    -> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6
```

--------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 20 ##

**What is meant by ground state and excited state?**
```
To show ground state and excited state we can use the flame test;
  * With the flame test we put different substances into a flame and then observe the color of the flame.
  * In a flame test the electrons in the substance are going from their ground state to their excited state and back to ground again.
```
**flame test**
![link](http://www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Metal-Ion-Flame-Tests.png)



**Example**
```
Na = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1

When you heat up / excite the electrons in Na, the shrongdonger model could become:

Na = 1s2 2s2 2p5 3s2

As you can see the 2p subshell lost 1 electron and the 3s subshell gained an electron.
If an atom's shrongdonger model has an electron missing in one shell and an extra in another then it is in its excited state.

When an electron goes back into the ground state it fills up the shell that is missing the electron.
```
**Looks like this**

![link](http://imgur.com/uNcQjVM)

**Ions in the shrongdonger model**
```
If you have an ion in the electron configuration; e.g.
Mg = 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2
Mg 2+ = 1s2 2s2 2p6

When you have a positive ion, it means that the atom has lost electrons.
In this case the magnesium has lost 2 electrons.
So when you write the electron configuration you have to remove 2 electrons from it.

Because of this if you can only see the electron configuration you cannot tell whether it is an atom or an ion.
```

**Identifying Excited State**
```
If an element's inner shell is not filled up and the outer shell is more filled up then it has excited electrons.
```
-------------------------------------------------------

## Lesson 21 ##
```
Example question:
  1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6
  1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 --> 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 3d1 [excited state]
```
**Weird textbook thing:**
```
Sometimes textbooks write the d shell before the next s shell. This makes it confusing to find the shell.
for example:
  1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d6 4s2 === 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6
if you see it like this then it is usually best to just change it back to the way ur used to.
```

**Core Charge**
```
Electrons are attracted to the nucleus by electrostatic forces.
  * Electrons are negative and protons are positive. Therefore they attract each other.
  * This attraction results in an electrostatic force.

There are two factors that have a major influence on the Electronegativity of the object;
  --> Core Charge
    * The positive charge created by the nucleus of the atom.
    * For example; a carbon atom has 6 protons therefore a core charge of +6;
  --> Distance to outer shell
    * The distance between the nucleus and the outer shell electron negatively effects the amount of positive charge acting on the electron.
    * Electrons that are in between the outer shell and the nucleus 'Shield' the electron and less charge acts upon it.

What is the core charge of a specific electron:
  To find the core charge of an electron we minus the amount of protons (atomic number) by the amount of non-valence electrons
  atomic number - nonvalence = core charge.
```
![link](http://imgur.com/CJxIkK2)
```
As you go from left to right on the periodic table the core charge of the atom increases (shown in gif).
As the core charge of the atom increases it's attraction to other atoms also increases. (Electronegativity)

As you go down the periodic table the core charge stays the same.
But the atom gets more shelles.
```

**Atomic size**
```
Across the periodic table core charge increases; therefore attraction between electrons and nucleus increases.
--> as this attraction increases the electrons get pulled in more and the atom becomes slightly smaller.

across ptable core charge increases
∴ attraction b/w nucleus & val e- increases
∴ e- held tighter
∴ atom smaller

Down ptable core charge stays the same:
∴ Core charge stays the same
∴ Number of shells increases
∴ More shielding
∴ Atoms will be slightly bigger than the ones above them on the table.
```

**Electronegativity**
```
The e- attracting power of an atom.

as you go across the ptable, core charge increases. Therefore:
  ∴ attraction between nucleus and valence electrons increases.
  ∴ Electronegativity increases.
  ∴ Attraction between atoms increases.

Down ptable core charge stays the same:
  ∴ Core charge stays the same
  ∴ Number of shells increases
  ∴ More shielding
  ∴ Less attraction between atoms
  ∴ Less Electronegativity

Because core charge is positive, the greater the core charge, the easier it is to attract negative electrons.
```

**Ionization energy**
```
The energy required to remove one electron from an atom.

Ionization is when an atom has lost or gained an electron. The energy required to remove an electron from an atom
is known as ionization energy.

as you go across the ptable, core charge increases. Therefore:
  ∴ attraction between nucleus and valence electrons increases.
  ∴ electrons held in tighter
  ∴ Harder to remove electron from atom because it is held in tighter
  ∴ Ionization energy increases

Down ptable core charge stays the same:
  ∴ Core charge stays the same
  ∴ Number of shells increases
  ∴ More shielding
  ∴ Less attraction between nucleus and valence electrons
  ∴ Easier to remove an electron
  ∴ Ionization energy decreases
```

**Metallic behavior**
```
Metals want to lose electrons;
Non-Metals want to gain electrons;

The reason for this;
  - The larger the core charge of the atom the more it wants electrons.
  - As you go from left to right you go from metals to non-metals.
  ∴ Metals are on the left of the table and non-metals are on the right.  

  Down ptable core charge stays the same:
    ∴ More shielding
    ∴ Less attraction between nucleus and valence electrons
    ∴ Easier to move an electron
    ∴ Metals like to lose electrons
    ∴ More Metallic
```
